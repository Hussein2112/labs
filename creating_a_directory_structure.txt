Create the 'Projects' Parent Directories
Create the first parent directory structure with the mkdir command, and use the -p switch:

mkdir -p Projects/ancient
mkdir Projects/classical
mkdir Projects/medieval
or

mkdir -p Projects/{ancient,classical,medieval}

Create the 'Projects' Subdirectories
Create the subdirectory structure:

mkdir Projects/ancient/egyptian
mkdir Projects/ancient/nubian
mkdir Projects/classical/greek
mkdir Projects/medieval/britain
mkdir Projects/medieval/japan
or

mkdir Projects/ancient/{egyptian,nubian}
mkdir Projects/classical/greek
mkdir Projects/medieval/{britain,japan}

Create 'Projects' Empty Files for Next Step
Create the empty files for later use:

touch Projects/ancient/nubian/further_research.txt
touch Projects/classical/greek/further_research.txt

Rename a 'Projects' Subdirectory
The user would like for the classical directory to be renamed to greco-roman.

mv Projects/classical Projects/greco-roman
