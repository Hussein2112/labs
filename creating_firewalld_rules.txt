Install firewalld.
To install firewalld, run the following command:

- sudo apt-get install firewalld
 
Identify the default zone of firewalld.
Use the following command to identify which zone is the default zone.

sudo firewall-cmd --get-default-zone
 
Create firewall rules.
These rules need to take effect immediately without restarting the firewalld service, as well as survive a reboot. This means we must enter two rules for each protocol: one with the --permanent flag, and one without.

Enter:

 sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=http --permanent  
 sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=http  
 sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=https --permanent  
 sudo firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-service=https     


Check to make sure http and https have been added, run:

 sudo firewall-cmd --list-services
