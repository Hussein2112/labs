Before you start the lab, make the user contractor1 exists and is assigned a password. Create the user if he doesn't exist.
Also, create the directory /opt/myapp and create file1 to file10 in that directory. Make sure 
the user contractor1 owns all those files



Lab:
Finding User Files and Reassigning Permissions in Linux
Use find to Locate Files
Before we can modify any file permissions, we've got to know which files need modifying. To find the files owned by the contractor1 user, let's run:

[stdnt5@chicago]$ sudo find / -user contractor1
Change Ownership of the Files
Now that we know where the files are, we can change ownership of them from contractor1 to stdnt5. It looks like /opt/myapp contains a lot of files he owns, so let's start by changing that:

[stdnt5@chicago]$ sudo chown -R stdnt5:stdnt5 /opt/myapp
If we run ls -l /opt/myapp, we can see the stdnt5 user and group own the directory now.

Check for More Files and Change Them
We can run the find command again to see what's left to change. There will be a few more things, like contractor1s's home directory and some mail. We can fix those with these two commands:

[stdnt5@chicago]$ sudo chown -R stdnt5:stdnt5 /home/contractor1
[stdnt5@chicago]$ sudo chown -R stdnt5:stdnt5 /var/spool/mail/contractor1
We can run the find command again to check, but at this point it looks like we've got them all.
