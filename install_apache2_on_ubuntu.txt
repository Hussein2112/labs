Install the Apache Web Server Package on Ubuntu WebServer
======================================================
You've been provisioned with an Ubuntu 16.04 LTS server and will need to install the Apache web server and Wget on it using the standard package manager:

sudo apt install apache2 wget 
Note: Ubuntu/Debian systems will usually start a service automatically, once its package is installed. You may need to update the package manager.

sudo apt update
Verify the Server is Running and Capture the Result
Using the wget package, capture the output of a request to the local Apache server's default site in a file in the home directory called local_index.response.

You can verify the service is running with:

sudo systemctl status apache2
And capture the output via the command:

wget --output-document=local_index.response http://localhost
