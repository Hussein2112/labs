Scheduling Repeated Tasks
Scenario
Develetech adopted a new policy that requires all users to fill in their time sheets every day. You'll create a daily reminder for all user systems.

Objectives
Completing this activity will help you to use content examples from the following syllabus objectives:

2.6 Given a scenario, automate and schedule jobs
Schedule a cron job to email a reminder every day at a specified time
Enter sudo crontab -u cmason -e to specify a cron job for Chris Mason.

Verify that Vim opens a temporary file automatically.

Type the following line in the file:

MM HH * * * /bin/echo "Please fill in your time sheet."

Replace MM and HH with the appropriate minute and hour time values in 24-hour time format. Ensure that the time you enter is three minutes ahead of the current system time. This way, you'll be able to see the message during the lab.

For example, if the time is 2:30 P.M., you'd type:

33 14 * * * /bin/echo "Please fill in your time sheet."

Save and close the file.

From the desktop menu, select the icons at the top-right, then select student01Log Out.

Select Log Out.

Verify that Chris Mason received the reminder for the scheduled job
Log in as Chris Mason.

You can ignore the Welcome screen, or you can step through the wizard to dismiss it.

Open a terminal.

Wait for the time to pass for the cron job to execute.

Remember, you can use date to check the time. You can also check the time from the desktop menu in the GUI.

Enter mail

Enter 1 to read the contents of the first email message.

Verify that the mail contains a reminder to fill in the time sheet.

Press q to quit the mail service.

Log out as Chris Mason and log back in as your student01 account.
