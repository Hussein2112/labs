Exploring the Linux Kernel
Scenario
As a system administrator, you may need to troubleshoot issues related to the kernel. So, you want to explore kernel concepts to refresh your knowledge.

View version information about the currently running kernel.

Log in  to your system
Enter uname -a to view information related to the currently running Linux kernel.
What is the base version of your currently running kernel according to the uname command?

 A- 2.4

 B- 2.6

 C- 3.4

 D- 3.10

 E- 4.18


True or False? According to the uname command, you are running a 32-bit hardware platform.


Which function is associated with the SCI layer of the kernel?

 A- Passing requests to device drivers.

 B- Sending service requests to the kernel.

 C- Allocating processor time for functions.

 D- Processing scheduling functions.

 E- Organizing files on the file system.




What are the major functions performed by the kernel? (Choose two.)

 A- Kernel initialization

 B- Process management

 C- Memory management

 D- Module installation

 E- Dependency management


Which of the following accurately describe the user space? (Choose two.)

A-  It is the area of the memory where the kernel executes its services.

B-  It is the area of memory in which most high-level software runs.

C-  It is the part of the system that only logged in users can access.

D- It is the area of memory in which background processes and low-level system libraries run.


What is one disadvantage of a monolithic kernel compared to a microkernel?

 A- Monolithic kernels are slower to access devices.

 B- Monolithic kernels are larger and consume more RAM.

 C- Monolithic kernels have a smaller kernel space and are less extensible.

 D- Monolithic kernels can only run the bare minimum software to qualify as a fully functional OS.


True or false? The Linux kernel is modular, enabling users to extend its functionality.
