Monitoring Devices
Scenario
As part of your routine system administration tasks, you need to track the devices used on all the computers on the network 
and maintain a list of hardware resources that are in use.

Objectives
Completing this activity will help you to use content examples from the following syllabus objectives:

2.7 Explain the use and operation of Linux devices

4.4 Given a scenario, analyze and troubleshoot application and hardware issues

Monitor any PCI devices that are connected to the system.
In a terminal window, enter lspci

Examine the brief list of hardware devices that are connected to PCI buses.

Each line lists the PCI slot a device is connected to, as well as the vendor and product model of the device.

Enter sudo lspci -v to view more information about each device.

Verify that you can see attributes of each device, such as:

Its vendor and product model.
Its I/O ports.
Its various capabilities.
The kernel modules and drivers it uses.
In the virtual lab environment no USB drivers are loaded. In a real, physical environment, you'd also be able to enter the 
lsusb command to see USB devices on your system.

Monitor a print job.
Enter base64 /dev/urandom | head -c 10000000 > printfile.txt

There are 7 zeros.

This will create a text file 10 MB in size using random data encoded in readable text (Base64). This file is large enough to take some time to print, so you'll have a chance to monitor it in the queue.

Enter lpr printfile.txt to start a print job.
Enter lpq and note that you can see the print job in the queue, including information such as:

Its rank (status).
Who owns the print job.
The number of the job.
What file(s) are being printed.
The total size of the request.
Allow the print job to finish.
