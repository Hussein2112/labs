===============================================
Set the minimum password length to 12 characters:
-------------------------------------------------
Run the command sudo nano /etc/pam.d/common-password.
At the end of the first uncommented line (line 25) add minlen=12, one space after sha512.
Save the file and exit nano.
Set the maximum password age to 180 days and the minimum password age to 3 days:

Run the command sudo nano /etc/login.defs.
Search for 99999 (press Ctrl + W to search).
Replace 99999 with 180.
On the next line down, replace the 0 with 3.
Save the file and exit nano.

-------------------------------------------------------
Configure accounts to lock out after 3 failed logins and remain locked out for 10 minutes. Do not configure the root account to lock out after any amount of failed login attempts.

Run the command sudo nano /etc/pam.d/common-auth.
Add a line above the first non-commented line and add the following code: auth required pam_tally2.so onerr=fail deny=3 unlock_time=600 audit


Create a temporary user account.
--------------------------------
The temporary account name should be shaqaale1, and it should expire one week from today.

Run the following command:
sudo adduser shaqaale1
Provide a password for the account.
Run the following command (replace <MM/DD/YYYY> with the date for one week from today):
sudo chage -E "<MM/DD/YYYY>;" shaqaale1
Verify that the account expiration is correctly configured by running the following command and checking the Account expires date:
sudo chage -l shaqaale1
