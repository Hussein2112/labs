Change the default SSH port 22 to port 22000.
To change the default port of 22 to 22000 for SSH, we'll need to edit the sshd_config file with the following command:

sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Then, we'll need to edit one of the lines:

Uncomment "#Port 22" and replace 22 with 22000
Now, we'll need to restart the SSH service:

sudo service sshd restart
 If SELinux is in enforcing mode, you have to tell  SELinux about this change.
# semanage port -a -t ssh_port_t -p tcp 22000

Restrict SSH by Source IP using TCP Wrappers.
We will need to edit the hosts.allow and hosts.deny files used by TCP Wrappers. Let's start with the hosts.deny file:

 sudo nano /etc/hosts.deny
Add the line:

 sshd : ALL
Then, save and exit the file.

Now we need to edit the hosts.allow file:

 sudo nano /etc/hosts.allow  
Add the following line:

 sshd : 10.0.0.0/24  
Save and close the file.
