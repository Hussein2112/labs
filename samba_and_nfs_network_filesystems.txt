Set Up a Samba Share
Install the Samba packages:

yum install samba -y
Edit /etc/samba/smb.conf and add the following section at the bottom:

[share]
        browsable = yes
        path = /smb
        writable = yes
Save and exit.

Create a user to share the mount point:

useradd shareuser
smbpasswd -a shareuser
Create the directory we're sharing out:

mkdir /smb
Start the smb service:

systemctl start smb
Make sure the client can write to the directory:

chmod 777 /smb
On the client, run:

mkdir /mnt/smb
On the client, install the CIFS utilities:

yum install cifs-utils -y
On the client, run:

mount -t cifs //<IP_OF_SERVER>/share /mnt/smb -o username=shareuser,password=<PASSWORD_SET_WITH_SMBPASSWD>

Make sure it's writable:

chmod 777 /nfs
Export the directory we've configured in /etc/exports:

Check to see what's being shared out on the NFS server:
