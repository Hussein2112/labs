Enable SSH to Connect Without a Password from the `dev` User on `server1` to the `dev` User on `server2`
We need to use SSH keys to satisfy this requirement, so generate them with this:

 [dev@server1]$ ssh-keygen
Then run:

 [dev@server1]$ ssh-copy-id <server2 IP>


Copy All tar Files from `/home/dev/` on `server1` to `/home/dev/` on `server2`, and Extract Them Making Sure the Output is Redirected to `/home/dev/tar-output.log`
We need to use a method of copying files over a network. scp is the best tool, like this:

[dev@server1]$ scp *.gz <server2 IP>:~/
Then connect to server2 using ssh:

[dev@server1]$ ssh <server2_IP>
Then we can extract the files:

[dev@server2]$ tar -xvf deploy_content.tar.gz >> tar-output.log
[dev@server2]$ tar -xvf deploy_script.tar.gz >> tar-output.log
Make sure to use >>, so that the output is appended rather than overwritten.

Set the Umask So That New Files Are Only Readable and Writeable by the Owner
The task is asking to make new files with the following permission: 0600.

So we can do subtraction to figure out what our umask should be.

0666 <-- Default

0600 <-- Desired

----

0066 <-- What we need to set

So we run:

[dev@server2]$ umask 0066
Verify the `/home/dev/deploy.sh` Script Is Executable and Run It
