First, make sure you have two spare disks ... sdb and sdc
if your disknames are different then apply your disknames accordingly
 
Create a 2 GB GPT Partition on `/dev/sdb`
Create our partition:

gdisk /dev/sdb
Use the following:

Enter n to create a new partition.
Accept the default for the partition number.
Accept the default for the starting sector.
For the ending sector we type +2G to create a 2 GB partition.
Accept the default partition type.
Enter w to write the partition information.
Finalize these settings:

partprobe
 
Create a 2 GB MBR Partition on `/dev/sdc`
Create our partition:

fdisk /dev/sdc
Use the following:

Enter n to create a new partition.
Accept the default for the partition number.
Accept the default for the starting sector.
For the ending sector we type +2G to create a 2 GB partition.
Enter w to write the partition information.
Finalize these settings:

partprobe 
 
Format the GPT Partition with XFS and Mount the Device on `/mnt/gptxfs` Persistently
Format the partition:

mkfs.xfs /dev/sdb1
View the attributes of the block device:

blkid
In the output, copy the UUID of /dev/sdb1.

Edit /etc/fstab and add the following line, replacing <UUID> with the one you copied:

UUID="<UUID>" /mnt/gptxfs xfs defaults 0 0
Save and exit.

Create the mount point:

mkdir /mnt/gptxfs
Mount everything that's described in fstab:

mount -a
 
Format the MBR Partition with ext4 and Mount the Device on `/mnt/mbrext4`
Create the filesystem:

mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdc1
Create the mount point:

mkdir /mnt/mbrext4
Mount the disk:

mount /dev/sdc1 /mnt/mbrext4
