First, we are going to break the selinux status of the webserver
as root
cd /root
vim index.html   # and write a message like Hello All then save the file
mv /var/www/html/index.html /var/www/html/index.html.old # in order to save the old index file

move the index.html file in the root home directory to webserver Documentroot
mv /root/index.html /var/www/html/index.html

Now the webserver should be broken. SELinux is complaining because from its point of view, the web server is trying to read content in the root's homedir


Verify there is an error by trying to access `localhost:80/index.html` using curl on the `www` host and check the audit log using sealert. Direct the output from sealert to `/home/cloud_user/seinfo.txt`.
Run curl localhost:80/index.html to confirm the error.
Run sealert -a /var/log/audit/audit.log > $HOME/seinfo.txt.
 
Examine `$HOME/seinfo.txt` to figure out what is wrong and fix the error regarding `/var/www/html/index.html`.
Reviewing the seinfo.txt file should indicate the context for /var/www/html/index.html is incorrect.
Run restorecon /var/www/html/index.html to fix the issue.
 
Restart `httpd` to check for other possible issues and correct any issues you might find.
Run systemctl restart httpd (note: httpd should fail to restart).
Based on journalctl --xe or by re-examining the audit log with sealert, you will see the file context is incorrect on /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf.
Run restorecon /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf to fix the context on httpd.conf.
Run systemctl start httpd and service should be restored.
 
Confirm `localhost:80/index.html` loads correctly with curl on the `www` host.
Run curl localhost:80/index.html and verify that you get the message "The website is up".
