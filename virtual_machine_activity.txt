Find the Name of the Virtual Machine on the Server
You will first have to sudo into the root user

[cloud_user@host]$ sudo -i 
To get a list of installed virtual machines you can run:

[root@host]# virsh list --all
check_circle
Start the VM
We can boot up a VM by running:

[root@host]# virsh start centos7.0

Determine the Location and Names of the Files that the VM Contain the VM Storage
We can look at the configuration of an individual VM by running:

[root@host]# virsh edit centos7.0
What we'll see is an XML file. Sections labled disk contain the source file for all the disks allocated to the VM.

We should see references to files in /var/lib/libvirt/images/, including centos7.0.
