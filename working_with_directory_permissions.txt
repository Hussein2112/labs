Create user groups.
There are four groups to be created:

accounting
engineering
management
hr
Use the sudo groupadd -g #### [groupname] command:

sudo groupadd -g 1111 accounting
sudo groupadd -g 2222 engineering
sudo groupadd -g 3333 management
sudo groupadd -g 4444 hr
 
Create directories.
There are four directories to be created:
accounting
engineering
management
hr
Create each group using the sudo mkdir /directoryname command:
sudo mkdir /accounting
sudo mkdir /engineering
sudo mkdir /management
sudo mkdir /hr
 
Add each of the newly created directories to its associated group.
Use the command sudo chgrp groupname /directoryname to add each of the newly created directories to its associated group:
sudo chgrp accounting /accounting
sudo chgrp engineering /engineering
sudo chgrp management /management
sudo chgrp hr /hr
 
Set group permissions on each of the newly created directories.
For each of the newly created directories, use the command sudo chmod g+rwx /directoryname to give the group owner read, write, and execute permissions to the directory:
sudo chmod g+rwx /accounting
sudo chmod g+rwx /engineering
sudo chmod g+rwx /management
sudo chmod g+rwx /hr
 
Prevent non-group members from accessing files.
In order to prevent other non-group members from reading and executing files in each of the newly created directories, use sudo chmod o-rx /directoryname command:
sudo chmod o-rx /accounting
sudo chmod o-rx /engineering
sudo chmod o-rx /management
sudo chmod o-rx /hr
