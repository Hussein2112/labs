Create Physical Devices
Get the names of our disks:

fdisk -l
Create the physical devices:

pvcreate /dev/sdd /dev/sde  #assuming your disknames are /dev/sdd and /dev/sde
 
Create a Volume Group
Create a volume group on the physical devices we created in the previous task:

vgcreate RHCSA /dev/sdd /dev/sde
 
Create a Logical Volume
Create the Logical Volume:

lvcreate -n pinehead -L 3G RHCSA
-n denotes the name of the LV.
-L denotes the size of the LV.
RHCSA is the name of the volume group we're creating this LV in.
 
Format the LV as XFS and Mount It Persistently at `/mnt/lvol`
Format the disk as XFS:

mkfs.xfs /dev/mapper/RHCSA-pinehead
Create a mount point:

mkdir /mnt/lvol
Get the UUID:

blkid
Copy the UUID, and edit /etc/fstab.

Create a new line that looks like:

UUID="THE-UUID-YOU-COPIED" /mnt/lvol xfs defaults 0 0
Save and exit, and then run:

mount -a
 
Grow the Mount Point by 200 MB
To grow the LV, run:

lvextend -L+200M /dev/RHCSA/pinehead
To have the LVM tools automatically resize the filesystem, you could pass the -r or --resizefs flags.

Another way to resize the filesystem is by running:

xfs_growfs /mnt/lvol
